# Handwritten Digit Recognition App

## Description:

This project implements a web application using Flask and PyTorch to predict the digit drawn by users on a canvas element. It provides users with a visually intuitive way to interact with a machine learning model for digit recognition.

## Key Features:
- User-friendly canvas for drawing: Users can easily draw digits on a designated canvas area within the web interface.
- Real-time prediction: As users draw, the app dynamically sends the canvas data to the Flask server for prediction.
- Probability distribution: The predicted digit is displayed along with its corresponding probability distribution, 
  offering insights into the model's confidence level.
- Clear instructions: The application provides clear instructions to guide users on how to interact with the canvas 
  and interpret the results.

## Technologies Used:
- Flask: A lightweight web framework for building web applications in Python.
- PyTorch: A popular deep learning framework with GPU acceleration capabilities.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Used for creating the interactive canvas interface and displaying predictions.

## Requirements:
Python 3.8 or higher
PyTorch 1.7.1 or higher
